This preserves the balance between the prediction loss on the one hand and the regularization losses on the other hand. It is particularly appropriate for models that use input-dependent regularization losses. Plain L2 regularization just superimposes weight decay onto the gradients of the prediction loss and is less in need of such a balance.\n",

        "If you use `tf.keras.metrics.Mean` to track loss across the two replicas, the result is different. In this example, you end up with a `total` of 3.50 and `count` of 2, which results in `total`/`count` = 1.75  when `result()` is called on the metric. Loss calculated with `tf.keras.Metrics` is scaled by an additional factor that is equal to the number of replicas in sync."
