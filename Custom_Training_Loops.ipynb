This preserves the balance between the prediction loss on the one hand and the regularization losses on the other hand. It is particularly appropriate for models that use input-dependent regularization losses. Plain L2 regularization just superimposes weight decay onto the gradients of the prediction loss and is less in need of such a balance.\n",
